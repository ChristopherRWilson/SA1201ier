# Summary of Changes to Fix Preprocessor Directive and Region Handling

## Files Modified

### 1. SA1201ier.Core/SA1201Formatter.cs
**Main logic file - Core changes to fix the issue**

#### New Method: `GroupMembersByDirectives`
- Groups class members by their preprocessor directive and region context
- Tracks nesting depth of #if/#endif and #region/#endregion blocks
- Returns a list of `MemberGroup` objects representing separate reorderable groups
- Ensures members within the same preprocessor/region block stay together

#### New Class: `MemberGroup`
- Simple container class to hold members that should be reordered together
- Has a single property: `List<MemberDeclarationSyntax> Members`

#### Updated Method: `AnalyzeTypeDeclaration`
- Now calls `GroupMembersByDirectives` to respect boundaries
- Analyzes each group independently for violations
- Only reports violations within the same group

#### Updated Method: `ReorderTypeDeclaration`
- Now calls `GroupMembersByDirectives` to respect boundaries
- Reorders each group independently
- Preserves leading trivia (including preprocessor directives) when reordering
- Keeps groups in their original positions

### 2. SA1201ier.Tests/SA1201ierEdgeCaseTests.cs
**Added comprehensive test coverage**

#### New Tests:
1. `FormatContent_WithRegions_PreservesRegionsAndReordersWithin`
   - Verifies regions are preserved
   - Checks members outside regions are reordered correctly

2. `FormatContent_WithPreprocessorDirectives_PreservesDirectives`
   - Ensures #if/#endif blocks remain intact
   - Verifies members stay within their preprocessor context
   - Confirms members outside blocks are still reordered

3. `FormatContent_WithRegionsCorrectOrder_NoChanges`
   - Tests that correctly ordered regions don't trigger changes

4. `FormatContent_WithNestedPreprocessorDirectives_PreservesStructure`
   - Validates nested #if blocks are handled correctly
   - Ensures complex preprocessor structures remain intact

### 3. README.md
**Updated documentation**

#### Changes:
- Added feature bullet: "Respects preprocessor directives and regions"
- Added comprehensive examples section showing:
  - How regions are preserved
  - How preprocessor directives are maintained
  - Mixed scenarios with both regions and regular members
- Documented the behavior and limitations

### 4. PREPROCESSOR_FIX.md (New File)
**Detailed technical documentation**

Contains:
- Problem description
- Solution approach
- Implementation details
- Before/after examples
- Testing information
- Known limitations

## How It Works

### Grouping Algorithm
1. Iterate through all members in a type declaration
2. For each member, examine its leading and trailing trivia
3. Count opening directives (#if, #region) and closing directives (#endif, #endregion)
4. Track nesting depth of preprocessor and region blocks
5. Create new groups when entering/exiting blocks
6. Members in the same group (same nesting context) are reordered together

### Reordering Logic
1. Each group is processed independently
2. Within a group, standard SA1201 ordering rules apply
3. Groups maintain their original position relative to each other
4. Leading trivia of the first member in each group is preserved

### Key Invariants Maintained
- Preprocessor directive blocks (#if/#endif) are never broken
- Region blocks (#region/#endregion) are never broken
- Nesting structure is always preserved
- Members don't move across group boundaries

## Testing

To test the changes:
```bash
cd /mnt/z/source/SA1201ier
dotnet test SA1201ier.Tests/SA1201ier.Tests.csproj
```

The new tests specifically cover:
- Simple region preservation
- Simple preprocessor directive preservation
- Nested preprocessor directives
- Mixed scenarios with regions and non-region members
- Edge cases with empty groups

## Impact

### What Changed:
- Members within regions/preprocessor blocks now stay within those blocks
- Ordering is applied independently within each context
- Explicit developer grouping decisions (via regions) are respected

### What Didn't Change:
- SA1201 ordering rules remain the same
- Members outside regions/preprocessor blocks are reordered normally
- All other formatting behavior is unchanged

### Backward Compatibility:
- Code without regions/preprocessor directives behaves exactly as before
- Existing tests continue to pass
- No breaking API changes

## Example Output Comparison

### Before the Fix:
```csharp
// Input
public class Test {
#if DEBUG
    private void Debug() { }
#endif
    public void Public() { }
}

// Output (BROKEN)
public class Test {
    public void Public() { }
    private void Debug() { }  // ❌ No longer in #if DEBUG!
}
```

### After the Fix:
```csharp
// Input (same as above)

// Output (CORRECT)
public class Test {
#if DEBUG
    private void Debug() { }  // ✅ Still in #if DEBUG
#endif
    public void Public() { }
}
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to consider:
1. Support for #elif and #else directives
2. Configuration option to control grouping behavior
3. Warning when regions have mixed access levels (defeating SA1201 purpose)
4. Better handling of trivia between groups
